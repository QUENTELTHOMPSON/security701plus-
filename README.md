######### Non-Disclosure Agreements-(NDAs) can be categorized into three types based on who signs them: unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral. 
Unilateral: A one-way agreement where only one party discloses confidential information 
Bilateral: A two-way agreement where both parties exchange confidential information 
Multilateral: A multi-party agreement where multiple parties disclose confidential information. NDAs are legal contracts that outline how confidential information can be shared and used.
They are often used in business and legal settings to protect trade secrets, client lists, and financial data.

NDAs can be used in a variety of situations, such as:
Mergers
When companies are considering merging, they may use an NDA to learn more about each other
Selling a company
When selling a company, the seller may use an NDA to learn more about the buyer
Collaborating
When two companies are collaborating on a project, they may use an NDA to protect each other's confidential information 
NDAs can also be used to protect the ability to patent an invention. If an invention is disclosed publicly, it may be compromised.
