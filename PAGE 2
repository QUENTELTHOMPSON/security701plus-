Bilateral: A two-way agreement where both parties exchange confidential information 
Multilateral: A multi-party agreement where multiple parties disclose confidential information. NDAs are legal contracts that outline how confidential information can be shared and used.

Mergers

Selling a company

NDAs can also be used to protect the ability to patent an invention. If an invention is disclosed publicly, it may be compromised.
